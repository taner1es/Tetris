# Tetris Clone Project

### What is this project ?
	This is one of the clones of epic tetris game, developed from scratch with standard 
	java libraries by me. And if you interested you can check everything behind a project 
	that created by an amator video-game programmer.
### What is the goal of the project ? 
	Just practising for beginning to developing games. Rookies of the game developing 
	hobbyists may want to check this project, to see how to develop game without using 
	any tools that prepared for game development like presents in game engines.
## How to build it?


### Prerequisites

You only need a Oracle JavaSE Development kit 9.0.4 or upper. Below versions may work but
I didn't try and to avoid any problem that is why I recommend.

### STEP 1 - Download JavaSE SDK ZIP

```
https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html
```

### STEP 2 - Open PowerShell CLI and Create a new folder to work on

```
mkdir C:\gitClonedProject
```
### STEP 3 - Extract files to the folder that we created (don't forget to replace pre-fix of downloaded zip file path)

```
Expand-Archive [your downloads directory path will be here]\jdk-11.0.1_windows-x64_bin.zip C:\gitClonedProject\
```

### STEP 4 - get tetris project files to your local computer

```
git clone https://github.com/taner1es/Tetris.git C:\gitClonedProject\Tetris
```

### STEP 5 - now we're ready to build project 

Switch Current Directory : 
```
cd C:\gitClonedProject\Tetris\Tetris\src\tetris\code\
```
Compile the source code:
```
C:\gitClonedProject\jdk-11.0.1\bin\javac.exe -cp ../../ ./Tetris.java
```
Run the game to test your binaries works fine or not: 
```
C:\gitClonedProject\jdk-11.0.1\bin\java.exe -cp ../../ tetris.code.Tetris
```
